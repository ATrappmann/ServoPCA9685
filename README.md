# ServoPCA9685

The library **ServoPCA9685** implements an interface given by the original
[Servo Library for Arduino](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Servo)
to the implementation of the
[Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library)
which allows us to control 16 Servos via an I2C-bus controlled PCA9685-board
as it is sold from Adafruit [here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/815).
